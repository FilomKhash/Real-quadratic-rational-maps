The code entropyunimidal.m computes the topological entropy of unimodal interval maps of the form 
<br /> x->2*mu*x*(t*x+2)/((t*x+2)^2+mu^2*x^2):[-1,1]->[-1,1] where |mu-t|<2, |mu+t|>2 and mu.t>=0. 
<br /> The code is based on the algorithm introduced in https://bit.ly/3kLnC9g. 
<br /> Other codes (entropy.m, entropy1.m, entropy2.m and entropy2alt.m) compute the topological entropy in two special cases: The logisitic family and the family defined by f(c_1)=c_2.
