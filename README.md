# Real-quadratic-rational-maps
The project was motivated by the elegant paper of John Milnor on quadratic rational maps https://bit.ly/3623BqT 
<br /> Part of the author's PhD Thesis https://bit.ly/3i11JRN
<br /> The codes for computing topological entropy have been used in papers https://bit.ly/3kHXRXy and https://bit.ly/2RW8CsQ 
<br /> In the Bifurcation folder, Codes bifurcation1 through bifurcation5 and bifurcationlogistic generate bifurcation diagrams for certain 1-parameter families of real quadratic rational maps.  
<br /> Codes in folders Entropy_Unimodal and Entropy_Bimodal compute the topological entropy for unimodal or bimodal interval maps in the normal form x->2*mu*x*(t*x+2)/((t*x+2)^2+mu^2*x^2):[-1,1]->[-1,1]
